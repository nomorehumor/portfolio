TripSync is a startup that provides sustainable mobility service for the inhabitants of Lagos, Nigeria and its area.
Lagos suffers from a severe traffic jam problem. The idea was to create seamless connectivity between different modes of transport. For example a passenger could first travel with a bike, then take the bus and in the end take the carsharing - all within one trip, which makes it cheaper and more sustainable.

## My tasks:
- Evaluation of requirements
- Estimation of infrastructure and personnel costs
- Implementation of a working prototype of mobile application
