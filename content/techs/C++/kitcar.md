KITcar e.V. is a student group at KIT university. The goal is to create a autonomous car model for the Carolo competition that can drive on a track analogical to the real-world street. The track has obstacles, stoplines, road signs and other objects. We managed to win the Carolo Cup twice, while I was a member of team.

For 2,5 years I participated as a member of Perception team, where we implemented solutions for car's object detection.

**My Achievements:**
- Supported the execution of tasks during Carolo Cup
- Optimization of execution time for stopline detection by ~60%
- Integration of a depth camera for more precision in object classification process. 
- Perception team leading for 1.5 years 
    - Onboarding new members
    - Planning new features 
    - Communicating with other teams.
