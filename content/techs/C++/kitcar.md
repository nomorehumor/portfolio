KITcar e.V. is a student group at KIT university. The goal is to create a autonomous car model that can drive on a track analogical to the real-world street. The track has obstacles, stoplines, road signs and other objects. 

For 2,5 years I participated as a member of Perception team, where we implemented solutions for car's object detection. One of accomplished tasks was implementing a new stopline classifier. Another one is integration of a depth camera that should bring more precision in object classification process. For 1.5 years I also was a team leader and managed different organizational tasks, like onboarding new members, planning new features and communicating with other teams.
