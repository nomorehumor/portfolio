The study project was made in a team of 5 people during the module Practice of Software Development at KIT in cooperation with Frauenhofer Institute. 
Me and the team developed a desktop application using __C++__ and __Qt__ framework that allows playback and editing (slicing, synchronizing) of 3D sequences captured using depth cameras. The display of the 3D scenes was implemented using __OpenSceneGraph__ and __OpenGL__ libraries.
We used a basic Waterfall development model and carried out all steps needed to plan, design (using UML), implement and test the application. 

My tasks during design and implementation were to ensure to create a synchronization (timeline) part of application. I also participated in implementing video playback and improving the performance using caching methods.
