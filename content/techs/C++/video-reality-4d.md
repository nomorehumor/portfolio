The study project was made in a team of 5 people during the module Practice of Software Development at KIT in cooperation with Fraunhofer Institute. 
Me and the team developed a desktop application using __C++__ and __Qt__ framework that allows playback and editing (slicing, synchronizing) of 3D sequences captured using depth cameras. The display of the 3D scenes was implemented using __OpenSceneGraph__ and __OpenGL__ libraries.
We carried out all steps needed to plan, design (using UML), implement and test the application. 

My tasks:
- Design and implement synchronization features (timeline). 
- Implementation video playback
- Optimized video loading by ~90% using caching
