[Roadia GmbH](https://roadia.webflow.io/) was a smart city startup, developing new generation of speed control and traffic enforcement cameras. Sadly, it finished its work in December 2023. 

Tech stack included C++, Qt, GStreamer library. The code was running on a Nvidia Jetson NX. This implied that code has to be optimized, due to limited resources.  

My responsibilities included implementing new features for the speed measurement camera. These included features that allowed more reliable testing and debugging, such as introduction of measurement video recording, new video formats (raw, lossless H.265) 

Apart from that, I created a PoC solution to ensure connectivity between the camera and remote server using 5G router and software to send the recognized vehicles to the server.
