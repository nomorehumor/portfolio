## Project: 
[CAS GmbH](https://www.cas.de/) is a company that creates different enterprise tools including Merlin configurator that is mainly used by salespeople to automate invoice generation. The possible product configurations can be manually created using complex rulesets in a desktop tool and then can be simply used in the Merlin web UI. As simple as it may sound, there are different options possible for different products including different pricing and sometimes companies want some specific features that my project team was implementing just for them. 


## My input:
My work involved developing new features for frontend and backend of the configurator tool. This included creating new business logic, extending databases (PostgreSQL and MSSQL) and creating UI (Angular, TypeScript) to use it properly. Sometimes I had to integrate other CAS tools with the configurator. I also enhanced UI by adding drag-and-drop feature for some areas and other nice stuff.
